# The functions described in the sequel are part of a tool set to compute the associated graded algebra to the gamma filtration or the geometric
# filtration on the representation ring of a finite group. They are not meant to be used by themselves but are instead called upon by more complex
# Sage functions, which can be found in the file gamma.sage. 

# Take G to be a finite group and reps its (ordered!) list of complex irreducible representations. We will denote its (complex) representation ring as R(G),
# the i-th \gamma-filtration step as \Gamma_i and the i-th geometric filtration step as F^i_geom. Furthermore we will write gr*_\gamma and gr*_geom
# for the associated graded algebras. In the rare case where it is not clear which group we are talking about, we will write \Gamma_i R(G), gr*_\gamma R(G)
# and vice versa for the geometric filtration. Lastly we denote by ZZ the integers.

# We begin by discussing the representation of virtual characters and (lifts of) Chern classes as (possibley nested) lists of integers throughout these functions.

# Elements in R(G) can be interpreted as virtual characters i.e. ZZ-linear combinations of characters of irreducible representations. 
# We will represent these virtual characters as lists of integers of the same length as reps. The i-th integer in this list will be the i-th coefficient
# (according to the ordering on reps) in the ZZ-linear combination of irreducible characters that describes the virtual character. 

# Note that gr*_\gamma R(G) and gr*_geom R(G) contain distinguished elements called Chern classes of representations. In fact gr*_\gamma R(G) 
# is generated as a ZZ-algebra by Chern classes of irreducible representations. The n-th Chern class of a representation phi is a degree n element 
# of gr*_\gamma and gr*_geom. It also has canonical lifts to \Gamma^n and F^n_geom as \gamma^n(\phi-deg \phi) given by \gamma-operations on R(G).

# For later computations, we will want to deal with elements of R(G) represented as integer polynomials evaluated in canonical lifts of Chern classes of irreducible
# representations. For example we will interpret elements of gr*_\gamma this way. These elements are represented as a pair of lists.
# The i-th entries in both lists describe the same element in two different ways, the first list as a virtual character, the second as a ZZ-polynomial (or sometimes ZZ-monomial)
# evaluated in abstract Chern classes of irreducibles. By abstract Chern class we just mean a symbol of the form c_k(i) that should be interpreted as the k-th Chern
# class of reps[i]. We represent c_k(i) as the nested list [1, [i,k]]. We represent a ZZ-monomial of Chern classes z*\prod^n_(j=1) c_(k_j)(i_j) as a nested list 
# [z,[i_1,k_i], ..., [i_n, k_n]]. We represent a ZZ-polynomial of Chern classes as a list [a_1,...,a_n] such that the a_i are the ZZ-monomial summands.
# Keep in mind that these are just symbolic descriptions that are not unique descriptions of elements in gr*_\gamma or gr*_geom.
# We call Chern classes represented by entries of these pairs of lists sometimes lifted Chern classes or concrete Chern classes.
