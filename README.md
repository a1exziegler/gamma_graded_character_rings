# gamma_graded_character_rings

This is going to be a Sage tool that computes the low degrees of the associated graded algebra given by the γ-filtration
on a ring of virtual characters of a finite group over the complex numbers. As of now this is a work in progress and can not be used yet.
This project uses [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/), [Macaulay2](https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/tree/master/M2/Macaulay2/packages) and of course [SAGE](www.sagemath.org).
