# The functions described in the sequel are part of a tool set to compute the associated graded algebra to the gamma filtration or the geometric
# filtration on the representation ring of a finite group. These functions depend on GAP functions provided in the file gamma-filtration.g.

# Take G to be a finite group and reps its (ordered!) list of complex irreducible representations. We will denote its representation ring as R(G)
# the i-th \gamma-filtration step as \Gamma_i and the i-th geometric filtration step as F^i_geom. Furthermore we will write gr*_\gamma and gr*_geom
# for the associated graded algebras. In the rare case where it is not clear which group we are talking about, we will write \Gamma_i R(G), gr*_\gamma R(G)
# and vice versa for the geometric filtration. Lastly we denote by ZZ the integers.

# The main interfaces to this code are the following functions
#   presentation - to compute low degrees of gr*_\gamma,
#   presentation_with_restriction - to compute gr^n_\gamma and check for non-zero elements that restrict to zero on some subgroups,
#                                   for example to search for elements that might vanish in gr^n_geom,
#   presentation_with_classes - to compute some approximation of gr*_geom in low degrees if it is not generated by Chern classes,
#   presentation_with_restriction_and_classes - to compute some approximation of gr^n_geom if it is not generated by Chern classes,
#                                               and check for non-zero elements that restrict to zero on some subgroups, for example to 
#                                               search for elements that might vanish in gr^n_geom.
# The precise meaning of "approximation" is explained in the comments directly above the definition of the function.
# For a precise explanation of the usage including examples and essential hints to improve performance consult the document readme.pdf.

# To this end a ZZ-polynomial ring in many variables is created and all of theses variables will be identified with elements
# of the augmentation ideal of R(G) that map to a generating set of gr*_\gamma.
# These will always be given meaning as abstract Chern classes of representations of G i.e. symbols that are mapped to Chern classes in gr*_\gamma
# or, depending on the context, also the canonical lifts of these Chern classes to R(G).
# The j-th abstract Chern classes of the i-th entry in reps as provided by GAP (where list start at position 1!) is represented as the nested list [1,[i,j]]. 
# Integer monomials of Chern classes are represented as nested lists [z,[i_1,j_n], ..., [i_n,j_n]] where z is the integer coefficient
# and the other factors are j_k-th Chern classes of i_k-th entries in reps. Integer polynomials are realized as lists of integer monomials.
